# Iterable iOS Objective-C SDK (deprecated)

`iterable-ios-sdk` is an Objective-C implementation of an iOS client for Iterable, for iOS versions 7.0 and higher.

# Deprecation

This version of the SDK is deprecated in favor of our [Swift SDK](https://github.com/Iterable/swift-sdk). The Swift SDK is fully compatible with apps written in Objective-C. No more updates or fixes will be made to this version.

If you have already updated to the new [initialization API](https://github.com/Iterable/iterable-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migration-notes), migrating to the Swift SDK will only require minimal changes.
